# Installation

prun can be installed by building from source. This guide covers installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later installed on your system
- Git (for cloning the repository, if installing from source)

## Build from Source

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BRAVO68WEB/prun
cd prun
```

Or if you already have the source code, navigate to the project directory.

### Step 2: Build the Binary

```bash
go build -o prun ./cmd/prun
```

This will create a `prun` binary in the current directory.

### Step 3: Install to PATH

#### Linux / macOS

Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv prun /usr/local/bin/
```

Or install to a user-local directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv prun ~/.local/bin/
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH. Add this to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Windows

Move the binary to a directory in your PATH, or add the current directory to your PATH environment variable.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Verify that prun is installed correctly:

```bash
prun --help
```

You should see the help message with available commands and flags.

## Alternative: Use Directly

If you don't want to install prun globally, you can use it directly from the build directory:

```bash
./prun
```

Or specify the full path:

```bash
/path/to/prun
```

## Using Make

The project includes a Makefile with convenient commands:

### Build

```bash
make build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run with Example Config

```bash
make run
```

## Development Installation

For development, you can build and test locally:

```bash
# Build
go build -o prun ./cmd/prun

# Test
go test ./...

# Run with your config
./prun -c prun.toml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error after installation:

1. Verify the binary exists in the PATH:
   ```bash
   which prun  # Linux/macOS
   where prun  # Windows
   ```

2. Check your PATH environment variable:
   ```bash
   echo $PATH  # Linux/macOS
   echo %PATH% # Windows
   ```

3. Make sure the binary is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x prun
   ```

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors:

1. Ensure you have Go 1.21 or later:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. Update your Go modules:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   go clean
   go build -o prun ./cmd/prun
   ```

## Next Steps

Once installed, check out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to create your first `prun.toml` configuration file.
