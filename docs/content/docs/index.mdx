This guide will help you get up and running with prun in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

- prun installed (see [Installation](/docs/installation))
- A project directory where you want to run multiple commands

## Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Create a `prun.toml` file in your project root. This file defines the tasks you want to run in parallel.

Here's a simple example:

```toml
tasks = ["app", "redis"]

[task.app]
cmd = "npm run dev"

[task.redis]
cmd = "redis-server"
```

## Step 2: Run Your Tasks

Simply run:

```bash
prun
```

This will start all tasks defined in your `prun.toml` file in parallel. You'll see output from all tasks with prefixes like `[app]` and `[redis]` to distinguish between them.

## Step 3: Run Specific Tasks

You can also run only specific tasks by passing their names as arguments:

```bash
prun app
```

Or multiple specific tasks:

```bash
prun app redis
```

## Interactive Mode

For a better experience, especially when running many tasks, use interactive mode:

```bash
prun -i
```

Interactive mode provides:
- A task list showing the status of each task
- Filtered log view for each task
- Keyboard navigation to switch between tasks
- Scrollable logs with PgUp/PgDn, Home/End

### Interactive Mode Controls

- `↑/↓` or `k/j` - Navigate between tasks
- `PgUp/PgDn` - Scroll logs up/down
- `Home/End` - Jump to top/bottom of logs
- `Space` - Page down in logs
- `q` or `Esc` or `Ctrl-C` - Quit and stop all tasks

## File Watching

Enable automatic restarts when files change:

```bash
prun -w
```

Or combine with interactive mode:

```bash
prun -i -w
```

You can also configure per-task watching in your `prun.toml`:

```toml
[task.app]
cmd = "npm run dev"
watch = true  # Restart this task on file changes
```

## Common Use Cases

### Full-Stack Development

Run your frontend, backend, and database together:

```toml
tasks = ["frontend", "backend", "database"]

[task.frontend]
cmd = "npm run dev"
path = "./frontend"

[task.backend]
cmd = "go run main.go"
path = "./backend"

[task.database]
cmd = "docker-compose up postgres"
```

### Microservices

Run multiple services in parallel:

```toml
tasks = ["api", "auth", "worker"]

[task.api]
cmd = "python -m uvicorn api:app --reload"
path = "./services/api"

[task.auth]
cmd = "python -m uvicorn auth:app --reload"
path = "./services/auth"

[task.worker]
cmd = "celery -A tasks worker"
path = "./services/worker"
```

### Development Tools

Run your app alongside development tools:

```toml
tasks = ["app", "redis", "vite"]

[task.app]
cmd = "bun dev"

[task.redis]
cmd = "redis-server"

[task.vite]
cmd = "vite build --watch"
```
